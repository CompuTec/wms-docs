## Barcode scanners connected to the computer

CompuTec WMS works with most USB and Bluetooth scanners connected to a computer; one crucial requirement is the availability to program the scanner for GS-1 barcode support (recommended) or to program it to add start/end of text sign.

Examples:

- Motorola LS2208 - USB scanner
- Champ SG300 – USB scanner
- Honeywell Granit 1981i – Bluetooth scanner
- Intermec SR61 – Bluetooth scanner

## Supported mobile handheld devices

### Motorola / Symbol / Zebra devices

- MC9200 family.
- Motorola MC65 – previously recommended by our consults – is no longer supported by the producer.

### Recommended devices

Although CompuTec WMS supports a wide range of devices, during several implementations, we developed a reliable model of device-system combination that we usually recommend to our partners and customers.

The best approach is to buy Zebra MC92xx terminals with Windows Embedded Compact 7, which we fully support, and later upgrade it to Android OS once we support it.
You can find this information on their website:

- [MC92xx](https://www.zebra.com/content/dam/zebra_new_ia/en-us/solutions-verticals/product/Mobile_Computers/Hand-Held%20Computers/MC9200%20Mobile%20Computer/fact-sheet/mc9200-os-upgrade-fact-sheet-en-0815.pdf)

It is required to buy it in **the Premium** version.
