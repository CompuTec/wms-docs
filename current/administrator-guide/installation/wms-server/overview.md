## CompuTec WMS Server automatic restart

Restarting the CompuTec Server WMS service at least once every 24 hours is required to make it work properly. This requirement is caused by extensive SAP Business One RAM usage (it is not a bug; it is just IT system specific).

You can set up the automatic restart in Windows Task Scheduler:

1. Set up the first task:

   1. Actions: Stop CompuTec WMS Server.
   2. Trigger set for a specific time every day.
2. Set up the second task:

   1. Actions: Start CompuTec WMS Server.
   2. Trigger set for a specific time every day (15 seconds after the stop).

This requirement is caused by extensive SAP Business One RAM usage.
