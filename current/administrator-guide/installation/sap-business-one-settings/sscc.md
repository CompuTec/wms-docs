To set the SSCC definition, open the following directory in the SAP Business One menu (the form is available after installation of CompuTec WMS):

## GS1 company prefix

## Serial reference

Setting a number here will define a series of numbers. Setting 000000001 will start a series of numbers (the following automatically assigned number is 000000001, 000000002, 000000003, etc.). It is possible to set a higher number to adjust it to a previous series used in a company.
