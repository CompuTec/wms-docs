# Old Pick & Pack

:::caution
    Pick and Pack are not supported for Items with ‘Issue Primarily by’ (SAP Business One option) set to ‘Bin Locations.'
:::

**Pick Pack and Production Manager** is an SAP B1 tool that allows the processing of Sales Orders, A/R Reserve Invoices, Production Orders (and ProcessForce Manufacturing Orders), and Inventory Transfer Requests from picking Items from warehouses to sending them to a receiver. It is performed by generating and managing Pick lists and later Delivery documents.
