# Pick & Pack

## Support of Storage Units

1. New Storage Units
2. Existing Storage Units (support only for Storage Units that have the same Items that are on the Pick List)

A top bar was added – for displaying an Storage Unit that is now in packing mode.

The change is related to the Pick List from the following documents:

1. Sales Order
2. Production Orders
3. Reserve Invoices
4. Inventory Transfer Requests

Support for both preallocation and without it (Custom Configuration: it is possible to block picking from different than assigned).

2. Locations also will be available in the list.
3. A possibility to scan:

    1. Item Code, Barcode, Batch / Serial Number, Item + Batch / Serial Numbers,\
    2. Storage Unit/SSCC:

        - new (not assigned to any of the locations)
        - existing, containing only Items from the Pick List
        - existing, containing only Items and Batches / Serial Numbers, locations from Pick Lists (if allocated before in SAP Business One).
    3. Location.

        After scanning a location, only Items with quantity picked from this location are displayed (or just present in this location if they were not assigned).
    4. Adding Storage Unit.
