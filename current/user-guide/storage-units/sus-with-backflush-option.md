# SUs with Backflush option

It is not possible to choose/use SUs with the Backflush option because there is no indication from which SU the Items are taken.

To keep the data integrity, it is required to close a related SU before issuing to production or create a new SU if there are Items left that must be recorded in a Warehouse.
