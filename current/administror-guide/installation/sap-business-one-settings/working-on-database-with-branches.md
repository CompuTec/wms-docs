# Working on database with branches

To be able to work with CompuTec WMS on a database with branches, the following steps are required to be performed:

- Create a user defaults file with a needed branch. Please check SAPthe  Business One manual to see how to do this.

- Assign a user to the branch in specific user settings (SAP Business One → Administration → Users).

Every CompuTec WMS operating user has to have a user defaults file (in which a branch is chosen) assigned.

CompuTec WMS users can be assigned to just one of the branches.
