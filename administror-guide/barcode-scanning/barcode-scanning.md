# Barcodes scanning

Many of CompuTec WMS functions can be operated by scanning barcodes. Here, you can find information on barcode scanning.

---

## Barcodes physical attributes

The minimal and maximal size of supported barcodes depends on scanner attributes.

CompuTec WMS supports every barcode standard as long as it is recognizable for a scanner used with the application.

In the case of using USB scanners (with desktop applications, e.g., on PCs or tablets), it is required to configure prefixes additionally.

## GS1 standard - CompuTec Decoder

GS1 barcode standard is supported by adjusting it to CompuTec WMS (see the table below). Full implementation of the standard is planned for future releases. To use CompuTec WMS-adapted GS1 standard coding, choose the right option in the Server options.

### Barcodes creation

Barcodes created to be supported by WMS have to have specific prefixes. A particular prefix is recognized only in a corresponding WMS screen; e.g., a barcode with a warehouse prefix will be recognized only when scanned on the WMS warehouse selection screen.

\* - Scanning decimal numbers have a different prefix (than 37). For QR codes, we recommend using the 310 prefixes.

310XNNNNNN
95XNNNNNN

Where:
310, 95 - prefix
X - a number of digits after which there should be a decimal comma (counting from the end)
N - digits

Examples:
2,5:
3101000025

0,25:
3102000025

0,025:
3103000025

## Custom Decoder

CompuTec WMS Custom Decoder offers an interpretation barcodes without prefixes. This option allows scanning of a barcode that does not have Application Identificators in GS1 or Odette standard.

To input data from a barcode without a prefix to a desired field, it is required to focus in this field.

In the future CompuTec WMS Team plans to implement a configurable prefix interpreter. This will allow the decoder to recognize barcode prefixes used in a specific compa

To use this kind of coding, choose the right option in the Server options.

## USB scanners

For testing barcode scanning, you can use a dedicated application: [WMS Scanning Symulator](ADD LINK).
