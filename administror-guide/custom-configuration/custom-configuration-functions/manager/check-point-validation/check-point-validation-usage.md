![Enable Check Point VAlidation](./media/enable-check-point-validation.png)

There are 6 points during transactions at which validation can take place:

  - Adding New Items

  - Picking quantity for an Item managed by Batches

  - Picking quantity for an Item managed by Serial Numbers

  - Picking quantity for an Item managed neither by Batch nor Serial Numbers

  - Before saving a document

  - Before saving an SU

  - On Item selection.

  -     Check a checkbox of a required point and click Load. In the Compare Value field, put a value the system will compare with a query result. If the value is the same, it allows a user to pass to the next step. If not, the query result will be displayed to the user.

  - In the right panel, there is a list of all parameters that can be used for the creation of a query/rule:

  - In the following example, we have a simple rule for adding quantity for an Item managed neither by Batch nor Serial Numbers. If a user sets a quantity lower than two and higher than 10, a message will be displayed, and the amount will not be added.
For HANA:

```sql

Select case when @Quantity > 10 then 'Quantity is too high!' when @Quantity < 2 then 'Quantity is too low!' else 'OK' end from dummy

```

For MS SQL:

```sql

select case when @Quantity > 10 then 'Quantity is too high!' when @Quantity < 2 then 'Quantity is too low!' else 'OK' end

```
